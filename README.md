# Arduino Blink LED ðŸ’¡

This project demonstrates the simplest Arduino sketch: blinking an LED.  
It turns the LED on for 1 second, then off for 1 second, repeatedly.

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno (or any board with pin 13 LED)
- Arduino IDE

## Code
See [blink.ino](blink.ino).

## Circuit
- Connect LED anode (+) to Pin 13
- Connect cathode (-) to GND

## Output
The LED will blink ON and OFF every second.
